In a shocking turn of events, the Terminids have broken free of their farms and begun spreading throughout the galaxy.
The Super Earth Armed Forces have been struggling to quarantine them on their farm planets, but are stretched thin – so when a mysterious new enemy enters the fray, Super Earth has no choice but to mobilize the Helldivers once again.
The Automatons are fully mechanized soldiers of a kind never seen before.
But their emblem is eerily familiar …
It is now up to you, Helldiver, to don your cape and take back Super Earth’s colonies once and for all.
You will be fighting these vile, freedom-hating foes on two fronts, as Super Earth works to implement a solution to the Terminid scourge.
As the Helldivers battle the foes of Super Earth, you will not only change the face of the galaxy, but the course of its history.
Super Earth will issue global, time-sensitive Major Orders, challenging all players to work together to achieve large-scale goals, the outcome of which will shape the story going forward.
Meaning, the story is not something that happens to players, but something the players themselves have to actively make happen.
Can the Helldivers pull together to defend vital strategic outposts against overwhelming numbers, or complete grand story missions before another faction makes their move? Not only time, but the blood, sweat and mangled bodies of Helldivers will tell.
Super Earth’s struggle for supremacy doesn’t end there—your future as a Helldiver is secure! There’s so much more to come as we expand the game’s content offering.
We’re excited to confirm that as players fight in the Galactic War, they will also witness events unfold through our planned free updates.
The universe of Helldivers 2 will grow and change to give our players refreshed gameplay, introducing new tools, new challenges, and new threats from around the galaxy.
