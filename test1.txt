Teyvat, composed of seven major nations, each of which is ruled by a different god called an "Archon", tied to a different element and ideal, and governed by a specific faction.
The mysterious floating island of Celestia hangs above Teyvat, allegedly home to gods, as well as mortals who have ascended to godhood through great, heroic feats.
Underground lie the ruins of Khaenri'ah, a mysterious nation which was destroyed by Celestia 500 years before the main events of the game.
Unlike the seven nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god, and sought to create a civilization led solely by humans.
