The Free City of Night City (NC) is an autonomous city located on the border between North and South California, on the Pacific coast of North America
It is considered a modern multicultural metropolis of the 21st-century, overrun by corporations, corruption, organized crime and gang violence
Night City was established at the head of Del Coronado Bay in 1994
Founded by Richard Night, it was originally known as Coronado City before its renaming in 1998
Night City has wide streets and dense urban skyscrapers which are home to millions of residents
It operates as a city-state, officially owning the title of Free City, with the Arasaka Corporation keeping a heavy influence over it
The metropolis is considered a thrilling and exciting location to visit, as well as an interesting and vibrant place to live for those of means, and a hellscape to the city's disenfranchised
Its world famous slogan is "The City of Dreams", originally changed from "City on the Edge of Tomorrow" In 2077, Night City was voted the "Worst place to live in America"
Richard Night, a successful businessman who during the early 1990s was concerned by the violence and disruption of the impending Collapse, saw himself in an unique position to deal with the forthcoming issue
Working mainly on corporate-funded projects, Richard decided to start a side company known as Night International, and began to plan an ideal new city — an environment that would be controlled and ultimately be safe from the ravages tearing the world apart
His new city was to be completely planned, self-sufficient, and capable of holding off even the most determined criminals
It would boast planned neighborhoods dedicated to preserving the feel of different types of nationalities and cultures, as well as a super-modern corporate center that would stand as a shining beacon of enlightened capitalism
It was ambitious, far-reaching, and visionary in its approach
Eventually, Night managed to secure the unheard-of amount of capital needed to finance such a large-scale project
With the Collapse, many corporations had been looking to establish their own urban areas — controlled zones free of crime, poverty or debt
A place where the government would be corporate-run, allowing optimum zoning and no anti-business elements to interfere with corporate growth
Ideally, it would be a capitalist mecca of opportunity
Night's dream city was tailor-made for their purposes and so he provided the design and construction capacities while these corporations lend in their funds
By 1992, Arasaka, EBM and Petrochem had all signed on with the project, leading to the formation of the Coronado Partnership
Needing lots of land for his new infrastructure development, as well as access to both sea ports and modern highways to deliver the huge amount of materials that he would need to construct it, Richard Night sent scouting teams to the East and West Coasts of the United States
Although in the end it was a small article in the San Francisco Chronicle that caught his eye — the article described a dreadful incident that had taken place in a small town called Morro Bay, along the Central Californian coast
Now a ghost town, Night was able to purchase the land where Morro Bay stood for a very low price
Petrochem helped in the acquisition, as the corporation had already taken over the town's then-abandoned Dynergy power plant and was already planning to set up an offshore port and oil terminal site
A leveraged 132 million dollar purchase secured the remaining parcels — including areas of Los Osos as well
Bankrolled by Merrill, Asukaga & Finch — who wanted to make the new city a financial hub — Night and Petrochem employed the Arasaka Corporation to remove the gangs and make the area a safe zone for construction
Further funds came from external investors lured to the project by the promise of lucrative building contracts and possible sources of extralegal income
In order to erase the stigma of the incident, the Partnership renamed the region Del Coronado Bay to make way for their new project of Coronado City
However, thanks to the rather out-sized personality of its founder, it soon became colloquially known by locals as "Night's City"
By 1993, the outlining of Coronado City required more terrain than what the geology of the bay originally had
Thus, the Partnership leveled the surrounding hills and dumped them into the ocean as fill, reshaping the bay in order that the formerly narrow sand spit to the west was widened to about 10 miles
They also re-dredged the harbor, making it capable of porting the large ships needed to build the metropolis, with the remaining dirt also ending up as fill on the western edge
The location was also the ideal place to build a station for the Planetran intercontinental maglev
Coronado City truly reflected its creator's eclectic vision
Instead of a huge construction of steel and glass, Night's urban plan broke the city into a series of neighborhoods, each with a different architectural style and theme
It included elements ranging from many notorious North American cities like New York and San Francisco, to faux brownstones and pseudo-Victorian gingerbread homes, while the Asian-like neighborhoods reflected its individual cultural styles
Small shops, restaurants, and businesses were designed to be within easy walking distance from urban living spaces, and a massive construction which came to be known as the New Harbor Mallplex was to be the place of a world-class mall
An open marina area would handle private vessels and other recreational boating activities while the main industrial port would be established north of the city
Night also paid homage to the small former township of Morro Bay by recreating much of its original layout in an open-air environment reminiscent of a seaside village
The city and corporate centers were going to be the glittering locations of high-rises and parks, and it was here where Night showed off his personal architectural skills in the designs of the many corporate skyscrapers, which would become the most visible sign of the city's rising affluence
Construction began in May of 1994
Although Petrochem and MA&F were the major bankrollers for the Coronado Partnership, they weren't construction companies, and as such they needed someone who could bring in the machinery and workforce to actually dig the holes and put up the steel, an issue that eventually led to employ the mob
The West Coast Mobs — such as the Mafia, Yakuza, and others — had maintained a stranglehold on heavy construction in the region for decades
They controlled the construction unions, transport unions, and most of the governmental agencies in charge of construction licenses, environmental impacts, and other building necessities
By investing a large amount of money into the Partnership, the organized crime mobs hoped they would not only make a huge return on lucrative construction work, but also have the inside track on future gambling, prostitution, and drug franchises in the new city
However, Night's plan required the use his own advanced building techniques and materials; which excluded a number of established unions and construction firms controlled by his new partners
This displeased them, and Night's further insistence that his new city would be safe and crime free angered them even more
During the first four years of construction, there were daily threats against Night's life, and when the threats escalated to the level of sabotage and intimidation, he called in his corporate partners, who dealt with the issue swiftly and ruthlessly
However, despite his influence and his allies promising to deal with it, Night's luck ran out
On September 20th 1998, he was shot and murdered in his penthouse suite at the top of the newly constructed Parkview Tower
Richard Night's killer was never apprehended, and in his memory, the newly appointed City Council officially renamed Coronado City as "Night City" in his honor
A year after her husband's death, Miriam Night restructured Richard's company and founded Night's Foundation, with the primary goal to protect and promote her husband's vision of the perfect city
This foundation would eventually be reorganized to become Night Corporation
Night City's Combat Zone appeared sometime between 1998 and 2000
Ever since Night's death, the corporations and organized crime of that time carved up the city's resources, which resulted in the Night City Police Department becoming completely ineffective
Gangs, backed by corporate and Mob sponsors, established themselves in the suburbs south of Central Night City and in time, these gangs became so entrenched that the only way to remove them would be to demolish the entire area and start from scratch
There were many discussions on whether or not Night City should had walled it off, but in the end, no agency, either civil or corporate, was willing to take the initiative to began such a massive undertaking
The following years were chaotic as the different powers battled for control of Night City, while the mob bosses who had killed the magnate began to appropriate of most of the metropolis
By 2005, the mob was the dominant force around Del Coronado Bay
They had been left alone due to the corporations having little to no interest in running Night City, and had most of their corporate strongholds in the outlying "beavervilles" and their lofty Corporate Plaza
In the meantime, the City Council was unable to lead the metropolis without corporate masters to pull the strings and provide the muscle
The organized crime organizations were great in what they did, but it wasn't the same running a whole city
Between 2005 and 2009, much of the city's government was replaced by corrupt mob-selected puppets, and even Petrochem and MA&F found themselves shoved aside in the rush to make the quick illegal eurodollars
Between selling contracts to their colleagues, setting up drug and extortion deals, and generally inviting the worst of the Collapse into the area, the mobs managed to turn a relatively clean, modern metropolis into an embattled war zone
Crime, drugs, prostitution, random violence, and cybernetic terrorism soon became the rule of law
By 2009, the name Night City had taken on a grim and deadly new meaning
These were among the worst years for Night City, with more murders in that four-year span than there were for most cities in ten
The mob ruled the city with an iron fist, destroying anything in its way
Gang activity was at an all-time high during this period, with notorious gangs such as the Blood Razors or the Slaughterhouse making their debut
Night City soon became the closest thing to hell on earth; a war zone where someone were just as likely to have their car blown up as have their radio stolen
The number of unsolved murders documented by the Night City Police Department rose into the thousands
After four years of street warfare, the corporations around the city finally began to take matters into their own hands
From 2009 to 2011, during the period of conflict known as the Mob War, the corporations battled the underworld for control over Night City
They didn't go to war to help the citizens, but because it was business
Like a rival corporation, the mob had its own goals, and these didn't fit into the corporate agenda
If the mob was not ready to play by the rules, the corporations would deal with them on the same level
Led by Arasaka-trained paramilitary troops in assault vehicles, fan tanks, and combat aerodynes — a wave of bombings, assassinations, and outright street battles descended upon the mob's ill-prepared members
When the smoke cleared, the corporations had utterly destroyed the mob's power base in Night City
From that point onwards, any time the mob crossed one of the corps, they would make sure to do it by their rules
At the end of the Mob War, the corporations placed a puppet mayor in power and started cleaning up the rest of Night City
The newly elected City Council — faced with the return of chaos in the city — deputized corporate security forces and allowed them full authority within city limits
Soon after, the corporate and city centers were cleaned out and restored to their pristine states
The same was done to the other neighborhoods, to varying degrees
After the governamental changes, the new corporate draconian policies contributed to the city's chronic homeless problem, as anyone who didn't have enough money to pay for the renovated version of the place they were living in were kicked out by force
This put hundreds on the street as affordable housing was upgraded and used to house the troops the corporations needed to maintain order
In the following years, this situation eased as fewer enforcers and security teams were needed to keep the streets safe
As negotiated in the Northern Separation Treaty of 2012 between the Californias, Night City was considered to be part of the Free State of Northern California; however, access was guaranteed to travelers from Southern California
By 2013, much of the worst excesses of Night City had been crushed under the ruthless heel of the megacorporations
The basic services such as police, firefighters, and support services had been reestablished
If the corporate masters were oppressive, at least to the average citizen, it was better than dodging gunfire on their way to the convenience store
In April the 13th of that same year, famous rockerboy legend Johnny Silverhand held a riot and concert outside Arasaka Tower in order to lead a strike team into the building to rescue his girlfriend Alt Cunningham
Many rioters and employees died in the event, including the American branch CEO Toshiro Harada, who was murdered during Johnny's assault
The tower was damaged badly, and over the following years was eventually replaced by the newly built towers
By 2020, Night City was a rapidly growing urban region, still rife with urban violence and street crime, but with strong economic growth in the corporate sector
It had evolved into a busy, successful, yet perilous metropolis, but possessed an urban slick and stylish cool that made it unique
The city had all but healed from the ravages of its bleak past
The Corporate Plaza was still pristine, and the NCPD had enough power to keep the downtown streets fairly safe during the day
However, like many other American urban areas, Night City had also devolved into an armed society
It wasn't strange to see as many guns as briefcases on the crowded city streets
The city government kept the control, but when things got out of hand they depended on the corporations to step in
Deals got made, money changed hands, a few people got killed, but others managed to avoid death in turn
Night City was far from Richard Night's original dream, however it worked well enough
Like many other cities around the globe during the Fourth Corporate War, Night City was also caught up in the power struggle between Militech and Arasaka
Due to its Free State status, NC was home to units on both sides of the conflict, and as such, it suffered badly from it
There were constant urban fights all over Night City, especially around the City & Corporate Centers, where both factions maintained substantial office complexes
Even before the nuclear event that wiped the downtown area out, people were abandoning the city in droves, doing whatever they could do to avoid getting sniped by drones, crushed by tanks, or just gunned down by corporate kill squads
A large area of Night City was wrecked and people were climbing all over themselves to get to safer spots like Heywood and Pacifica
Among all the chaos, both sides went over the line when the bomb went off
The 140th floor tall Arasaka Towers were the North American base of operations of the Japanese corporation
The complex was among the tallest buildings that existed at the time, being the largest in Night City
On August 20 2023, a Militech incursion team led by Morgan Blackhand and Johnny Silverhand attempted an infiltration mission into the Towers in order to destroy Arasaka's Reliquary Database Project
The idea was to render the project unusable for the rival corp by using a tactical nuke with the planned area, a heavily shielded complex, to absorb the impact of the blast and prevent massive destruction
However, somehow the nuclear device prematurely detonated on the 120th floor of the southern tower
The explosion instantly obliterated the Arasaka Towers, splitting them in half and causing both structures to collapse outward
The entirety of the City & Corporate District turned into ruins within seconds, with almost everyone in the immediate area dying
The blast instantly incinerated over 12,000 people in the vicinity of the Towers, and fatally injured upwards of half a million more
Another quarter million died in the resulting aftermath over weeks and months
This event would be known as the Night City Holocaust, or the AHQ Disaster
Being technically an air blast detonation, it lessened the overall long-term radioactivity, and most of the remaining radiation penetrated only the huge skyscrapers surrounding the blast area
Since much of Night City and its surroundings were built on fill, and because the elevation was originally very low, the nuke caused a minor earthquake that liquefied parts of the fill and flooded the inner parts of the city
The huge blast turned the tons of raw concrete and steel of the buildings into particulate debris that covered the entirety of Northern California and far out to sea for many months, as well as igniting a fierce firestorm that covered thousands of acres beyond the city
The metropolis was barely habitable within 24 hours of the detonation
Lots of Night Citizens were unaffected by the initial fallout as they were mostly cybered up or had radioactivity filters installed in their bodies already
However, the firestorm destroyed a large portion of the city's housing, forcing people to move over to either the suburbs on the other side of the bays, or to the areas further out
The liquified shaking soil caused by the explosion broke gas mains, water pipes, and electrical grids
The combined dust cloud caused by the event spiraled up into the sky and turned it red with particulate matter for almost two years
Even many years after the explosion, suspended particles caused the skies at dawn and dusk to glow a lurid red, inspiring people who lived through that timespan to call it the Time of the Red
Within hours of the disaster, then US President Elizabeth Kress — former Militech CEO — nationalized Militech through the expedience of their current CEO — General Donald Lundee — and his reserve commission, placing them under the control of the still sizable United States military
Kress blamed the Night City attack on the Japanese corporation and banished all of the Arasaka forces from the continental US
However, she was soon able to determine that the actual weapon used had been supplied by a Militech strike team
Bringing the full force of her military and propaganda resources to bear, President Kress decided to paint a lurid picture of Arasaka as an evil foreign megacorporation run by a madman, who wanted only the destruction of an American city in the pursuit of personal power
Arasaka's charters to operate in the NUSA were immediately revoked, its members and board were declared terrorists, and its assets either seized or driven off-shore
The Big Lie pushed forward by Militech and the US was that Arasaka themselves had blown up the Corporate Center of Night City in an area denial attack to stop Militech from seizing control of the Arasaka Towers
The truth is it was never formally decided who had triggered the explosion
In the public's eyes, the reasoning for the nuclear detonation was never uncovered
Some believed it was Militech's overzealous desire to crush Arasaka, while others believed it was an area denial weapon set off to protect the Arasaka Towers
Despite all the political play, President Kress showed little to no interest in helping Night City recover
Much as previous Presidents during the Collapse had done, she wrote the city off as unrecoverable and offered sanctuary in a New United States to the surviving refugees
There were two reasons for this; first, with the resources of the NUSA already stretched to the breaking point, there were too few options left for her
Second, the American President saw this as the perfect way to bring the wayward Free State of Northern California back into the government's control
Night City however, resisted the rule of the New United States
Roughly two million people in the greater Night City area were left homeless due to the bomb, either directly or because of the flooding from the liquefaction of the city's foundations — which were built on fill and sand
Survivors fled into overcrowded tent shanty towns in the surrounding suburbs of North Oak, Westbrook, Pacifica, Heywood, and South Night City
But soon enough it was obvious that something needed to be done quickly
The remnants of the Night City government and its citizens turned to outside resources, calling in old markers and favors from a wide variety of people — including nomad families, small corporations and edgerunners
Recovery was led by the Aldecaldos nomad clan and their allies in the StormTech Corporation
With a lot of experience in city rebuilding due to the Chicago project, StormTech and the Aldecaldos were uniquely equipped to construct extensive temporary housing from shipping containers, and afterwards formocrete modules brought in by rail and sea
Firstly though, the ground needed to be cleared to put up even these rudimentary structures
Most of the central corporate zone had been destroyed, including the government buildings
The wreckage was far too vast to dig up and cart to distant landfills, so the survivors used bulldozers and jury–rigged main battle tanks — abandoned by both sides — to shove the debris into the bay
Night Corp offered generous rewards to anyone willing to help clean up the crater of radioactive rubble at ground zero
Both the corporation and the City Council claimed that casualties were kept to a minimum, while at the same time they didn't provide official statistics to substantiate said claim
Much of Night City's inner neighborhoods had already been razed to the ground in the ceaseless battles preceding the Fall of the Towers, so the wreckage became the fill that new megabuildings and old cityscapes used to rise again, once more ready to challenge the smog-filled skies
Many of the old districts had become a part of the new Combat Zones, and the original heart of the metropolis was still completely devastated
During the Time of the Red, an "ad hoc, loose grouping" of states known as the Pacifica Confederation was occupied restoring much of the infrastructure lost to the war
They allowed Night City to continue as an independent "city-state" of sorts, granting it the opportunity to become a free trade zone within the Confederation, as well as becoming an entry point for the rest of the world that did not want to deal with the US in any way
By the 2040s, most cities in the Confederation had CitiNets and Data Pools thanks to Ziggurat
By 2045, Night City was still in the process of rebuilding
This ongoing rebuilding period cemented Night City's relationship to the outer world
Abandoned by President Kress and the New United States, Night City had no intention of ever going back into their failing fold
At that time, there was a rampant speculation that the NUSA government had used Arasaka as a scapegoat for the nuclear detonation, obtaining with this the opportunity to slander the corp's reputation
It was at some point of the early 2040s when the truth was finally unveiled
Trace Santiago, a young independent media, managed to obtain information about what truly went down in 2023, writing several exposes and books about the Fourth Corporate War and the Time of the Red
With this story published, the Big Lie — the deception created by President Kress to blame Arasaka for the AHQ Disaster — completely crumbled
This publication backfired spectacularly against Militech and the NUSA, driving Night City to realign itself with Arasaka rather than the United States
Despite this, many Night Citizens still believed Arasaka was responsible for the nuke, or at the very least they were responsible for the incident as the corporation was the reason the war reached Night City, since the metropolis was Arasaka's North American center of operations
After these revelations, opinion was very divided, with many hating on Arasaka while others preferring to see the return of the Asian corporation rather than submit to the federal rule of the NUSA government
As for the EEC and Soviet Union; Night City council considered them pleasant trading partners as long as they didn't disrupt the harmony of the city
In May 4th 2063, the Avian Extermination Act was approved by the City Council after a series of zoonotic disease outbreaks, eliminating all birds within 18 miles of the city limits
Personal pets could be kept though
Progressively, most of the animal wildlife in NC disappeared too
During the mid-2060s, the new Pacifica project was approved
With the economic recovery, investors sought an opportunity to make money on tourism
Billions of eurodollars were poured in an attempt to turn the southern suburbs of Night City into a booming tourist resort
Construction was well underway when the Unification War started
Most investors withdraw their funding, abandoning Pacifica and leaving it to the locals
At the end of 2069, the recently elected NUSA President Rosalind Myers, ex-CEO of Militech, proposed a federal rule designed to bring the Free States to heel by federalizing them under the pretense of strengthening the nation
Most of the American fully autonomous states opposed this unification, and conflict soon followed between the NUSA and a number of Free States — the Unification War
Night City — at the time part of the Free State of Northern California — wanted to remain neutral in the conflict
NorCal had allied with the rest of Free States while SoCal had decided to back the NUSA government, thus positioning Night City in the middle of two warring states
Its citizens held their breath as they waited for federal troops to invade, though in the end they managed to barely avoid the fight
In early 2070, while a division of federal troops were advancing towards the outskirts of Night City, the then-Councilman Lucius Rhyne used his decade long list of contacts to beg the long-shunned Arasaka Corporation to protect them
A few days after the councilman's plea, an Arasaka supercarrier appeared in Del Coronado Bay and mere hours later the NUSA troops retreated
Not long after Arasaka's open intervention, the Treaty of Unification was signed in June 2070, putting an end to the war
President Myers feared the increased presence of Arasaka could escalate the conflict, something the NUSA was not prepared for at the time
The treaty was unsatisfactory to all parties but was preferable rather than to continue the war and risking another global crisis
The treaty also rededicated Night City as an international autonomous free city, without having to answer the governance and laws of North California or the NUSA, and obtaining the title of Free City
However, this new liberty was paid costly as it allowed the megacorporations to further increase their rule over Night City, pumping money into its revitalization in order to establish a foothold on the North American West Coast
The symbolic pinnacle of this event took place that same year when the Night City government — which included the newly elected mayor Lucius Rhyne — gave Arasaka a seat in the City Council and allowed them to build their new American headquarters in the downtown area, on the site where their previous office had been destroyed in 2023
The city felt prosperity again, but it was not enjoyed by all
After the war, some investors tried to restart the Pacifica project, but they were met with resistance from the local community
The NCPD attempted to clear the area but to no avail
In fear of a bloodbath, the chief of the NCPD ordered the withdrawal and soon afterwards the City Council shut down all city services there to force the locals to leave — this attempt prove unsuccessful
Slowly, Pacifica turned into a new Combat Zone within the Night City area
In the following years since their comeback, Arasaka extended its dominion over Night City
They were able to take out a number of corporate rivals, and build the impressive, yet ominous Arasaka Waterfront in Watson
In 2072, an outbreak of zoonotic disease called the Rat Fever occurred in the city
In 2074, Night City celebrated the eightieth anniversary since its founding
That same year, a cyberpsycho attack in Kabuki caused the death of three citizens
NUSA President Rosalind Myers, after hearing of said events, offered to help protect the NC citizens with forces from Militech
These words were sharply criticized by the Night City Police Commissioner at that time
In 2076, the city's birthrate fell by 7%, becoming the third worst decline in North America
By 2077, real animals in Night City are more than a rarity to behold, and while cats were said to be the last ones to disappear, it is still possible to encounter them in a precious few locations
The Night City Environmental Task Force have been using stray cats to address the rat plague in Watson
Where these animals can be found it is clear that they are taken care of by the city citizens, at least in terms of primary needs, although it does appear that they remain unowned due to the absurdly extortionate pet tax
Birds have also been occasionally sighted
Power outages are a very common occurrence in the city
Mayor Rhyne was due for re-election in 2077
Councilman Jefferson Peralez, a staunch adversary of corporate influence, planned to run against him
Rhyne unexpectedly died, with the official cause of death attributed to the implants regulating his heart malfunctioning
Deputy Mayor Weldon Holt became Acting Mayor, and a new election was called in which both Holt and Peralez announced they would run, along with several other unidentified candidates
Peralez eventually prevailed over Holt and the other candidates in the election, winning either a majority or a plurality of the vote, and became the next mayor of Night City
