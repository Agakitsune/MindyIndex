BioShock takes place in Rapture, a large underwater city planned and constructed in the 1940s by individualist business magnate Andrew Ryan, who wanted to create a utopia for society's elite to flourish outside of government control and "petty morality".
This philosophy resulted in remarkable advances in the arts and sciences, which included the discovery of "ADAM": a potent gene-altering substance which is created by a species of sea slug on the ocean floor.
ADAM led to the creation of "Plasmids", mutagenic serums that grant users super-human powers such as telekinesis and pyrokinesis.
To protect and isolate Rapture, Ryan outlawed any contact with the surface world
