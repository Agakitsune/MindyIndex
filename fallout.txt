Vault 427 was designed to be completely sterile, with no bacteria or viruses allowed inside.
The residents were all given powerful antibiotics and antiseptics to keep them healthy, but they were never told that the experiment was to see how their immune systems would react to being completely unused.
The scientists in charge of the experiment were interested in studying the long-term effects of a sterile environment on the human body, particularly the immune system.
The residents of Vault 427 were carefully screened for any pre-existing conditions or immune system abnormalities before being allowed inside.
They were also given a battery of tests to determine their immune system’s baseline functionality.
Once inside, they were completely isolated from the outside world, with all air and water being filtered to ensure that no pathogens could enter the vault.
At first, the residents of Vault 427 seemed to be thriving.
They had no sickness or disease, and their physical health was excellent.
However, as time passed, the scientists began noticing some troubling trends.
The residents’ immune systems were becoming weaker and less effective, as they had nothing to fight against.
Without the constant exposure to pathogens that the human body is designed to encounter, the residents’ immune systems were shutting down.
As the years went by, the situation in Vault 427 began to deteriorate rapidly.
The residents’ immune systems were so weakened that they were unable to catch the mutations that lead to cancer.
Normally, a healthy immune system can catch most mutations and kill them before they can cause harm, but in Vault 427, the residents’ immune systems were no longer functioning properly.
Cancer began to spread throughout the vault, and many of the residents began to fall ill despite living perfectly healthy lifestyles with minimal carcinogenic exposure.
When the vault finally opened, the surviving residents found themselves completely unprepared for the outside world.
They had no natural immunity to anything and were incredibly vulnerable to even the most basic infections.
Many of them fell ill and died within days of leaving the vault, while others struggled to adjust to a world that was filled with bacteria and viruses that they had never encountered before.
The scientists who conducted the experiment were shocked and saddened by the outcome, realizing too late the true consequences of a sterile environment on the human body.
Overall, Vault 427 was a tragic and disturbing experiment that showed just how important a functioning immune system is for human survival.
While the scientists who conducted the experiment may have learned a lot about the human body’s response to a sterile environment, it came at a terrible cost to the residents of the vault.
