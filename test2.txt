Helldivers 2 is set a century after the triumph of "Super Earth", a self-described managed democracy, over the Cyborgs, Terminids, and The Illuminate during the events of the first game.
It is discovered that, upon death, the Terminids produce a unique and highly valuable resource known as E-710.
Farms are established on human-colonized worlds, but containment is eventually breached, releasing the bugs and causing chaos and destruction.
Simultaneously, a new threat emerges in the form of the Automatons, a mechanical army intent on destroying humanity.
The game begins with a recruitment video for the Helldivers, who are elite shock troops dropped from orbit to reclaim the colonized lands.
Environmental storytelling is prevalent throughout the game, with various logs, notes, and propaganda messages available for players to find during gameplay
